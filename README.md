# 🌍 Heritago  
_Explore national parks, UNESCO sites, and natural wonders around the world._

Heritago is an exploration tool for discovering protected natural sites — including **UNESCO World Heritage locations** and **national parks from around the globe**.

While the long-term goal is to shift the focus toward **U.S. nature destinations** (national parks, forests, monuments, etc.), the project currently remains global and is actively evolving.
